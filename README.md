## Why

[Cljfmt](https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt) already exists, and it's
implementation looks good. However, it is not configurable enough for
my use and I need tool where reporting the problems is the main use,
and automatically fixing them is secondary. I think reporting
the problems is important so the users are able to learn from their mistakes,
and to fix their editor configuration etc.
